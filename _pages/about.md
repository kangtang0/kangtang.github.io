I'm a third-year postgraduate student from [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yongsheng Ma](https://www.XXX.com/) of Engineering Informatics Lab from the Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology. I also work with [Prof. Sheng Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sheng-Xu-8) from [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology](http://english.siat.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences.
