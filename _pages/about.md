I'm a third-year postgraduate student from [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes 1) signal processing, source localization, and state estimation; 2) human sensing, wireless intelligent sensing systems, and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yongsheng Ma](https://www.XXX.com/) of Engineering Informatics Lab from the Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology. I also work with [Prof. Sheng Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sheng-Xu-8) from [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology](http://english.siat.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences.

You can find my CV here: [Kang Tang's Curriculum Vitae](../files/CV_Kang Tang.pdf).

I am looking for a PhD position enrolled on fall 2024; if you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me: [Email](mailto:12132291@mail.sustech.edu.cn) / [Wechat](../images/Kang_wechat.jpg)
